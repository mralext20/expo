Girls Who Code seeks to educate, equip, and inspire girls with skills they will need to pursue 21st century opportunities. During the Girls Who Code summer camp, girls learn about computer science, gain exposure to tech jobs, and join a sisterhood of women who are using computer science to become change makers.
