First Tech Challenge Team #16880, the Cyberian Tigers from Career and Technical High School are the 2021 Alaska state FTC champions.  A huge thanks to them for producing this video for our 2021 virtual expo. 

Also, Mat-Su Career & Technical High School students demonstrate the power of their CNC machine.  CTHS students have used their CNC, in conjunction with AutoCad and Fusion360 software, to create numerous projects this year including signage for their tiny-house project, school benches, and a new CTHS school sign.
