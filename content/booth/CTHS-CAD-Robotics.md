Mat-Su Career & Technical High School students demonstrate the power of their CNC machine.  CTHS students have used their CNC, in conjunction with AutoCad and Fusion360 software, to create numerous projects this year including signage for their tiny-house project, school benches, and a new CTHS school sign.
